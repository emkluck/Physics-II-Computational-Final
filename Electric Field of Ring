##prompt
##  consider a charged ring of radius R that lies int he xy plane and is centered at the origin. You should recall that we intergrated the electric fields produced by charges around this ring to show that 
##  Ering=kqz/(R**2+z**2)**3/2 at points along the z axis. We would also predict that the electric potential at points along the z axis is given by V=kq/z + C. Write a program that verifies this prediction
##  By numerically evaluating the intergral -int (E*dl), moving in small steps outward from the origin and making a graph of V(z). You might want to start with a total charge of 50 nC and a radius of 0.1m.
##  you should vary the size of your steps until they are small eneough that your result no longer strongly depends on exactly how small they are
